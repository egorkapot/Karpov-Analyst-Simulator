# Karpov-Analyst-Simulator
Karpov Analyst Simulator course. During this course I have done several projects, notably:

1. <u>Conducted A/A and A/B testing using Poisson bootstrap, Mann-Whitney test and t-test and made recommendations for the introduction of a new algorithm</u>
2. <u>Built ETL pipeline in Airflow</u>
3. <u>Created my own Telegram bot for collecting and sending reports and automated its work using Airflow</u>
4. <u>Set up search automation and anomaly alerts in the main metrics</u>
