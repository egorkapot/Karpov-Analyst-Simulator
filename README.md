# Karpov-Analyst-Simulator
Karpov Analyst Simulator course. During this course I have done several projects, notably:

1. <b>Conducted A/A and A/B testing using Poisson bootstrap, Mann-Whitney test and t-test and made recommendations for the introduction of a new algorithm</b>
2. <b>Built ETL pipeline in Airflow</b>
3. <b>Created my own Telegram bot for collecting and sending reports and automated its work using Airflow</b>
4. <b>Set up search automation and anomaly alerts in the main metrics</b>


<h2> This repository contains 4 working files for different projects </h2>

I will provide a link for a readme file for each project
